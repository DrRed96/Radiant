# NOTICE

**TL;DR:** This project modifies and builds on decompiled Minecraft source from MCP and OptiFine. It’s not affiliated with Mojang, Microsoft, OptiFine, Forge, or MCP. Read the full notice below and see the LICENSE file for complete details.

This document explains the legal notices, origins, and licensing details related to the Radiant project.

Radiant is a community-maintained project that builds on the Minecraft source code decompiled and mapped using MCP (Minecraft Coder Pack). The Radiant Contributors modify and extend this code to improve performance, readability, and usability.

Radiant includes decompiled OptiFine code, which had some Forge ties that we removed as much as possible.

Radiant does **not** include or redistribute the original MCP tools, scripts, or configuration files. MCP has its own license terms that prohibit redistribution of those parts and commercial use. You must get MCP separately if you want to run the decompile process yourself.

Radiant is based on Minecraft source code as provided through MCP’s decompiled version, which comes from Mojang Studios/Microsoft. Because MCP’s decompilation tools are old and decompilation is never perfect, this code contains artifacts and differs from the original source.

Minecraft is a proprietary product of Mojang Studios, a subsidiary of Microsoft. This project is **not affiliated with, associated with, authorized by, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected to** Mojang, Microsoft, OptiFine, Forge, or the MCP team.

Radiant may include additional improvements, fixes, and features contributed by the community. These contributions might reference or derive from other open-source projects, following their licenses.
