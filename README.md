## What is Radiant?
This is a project dedicated to creating a publicly usable version of MCP 1.8.9 with pre optimized tweaks and bug/exploit fixes using [Optifine](https://optifine.net) version M6-Pre2.
There are also plans to add qol features/improvements to small annoyances with minecraft.

## Features
- Increased Performance
- Lower/Reduce Memory Usage
- Exploit/Bug Fixes
- QOL (Quality Of Life) Features

## Todo
- Patch all known packet exploits
- Optimize network stack as much as possible without sacrificing security (velocity networking)
